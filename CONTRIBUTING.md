# Code of practice

As a tool suitable for security personnel testing, it is very dangerous to have driver permissions if you use it indiscriminately.

It is recommended that you start ARK with an unloaded driver in the R3 state

If you must use driver permissions, it is recommended that you use a valid driver signature and use ark normally and minimize threats
